abstract: 'Empirical software engineering research often depends on datasets of code repository artifacts, where sampling strategies are employed to enable large-scale analyses. The design and evaluation of these strategies are critical, as they directly influence the generalizability of research findings. However, sampling remains an underestimated aspect in software engineering research: we identify two main challenges related to (1) the design and representativeness of sampling approaches, and (2) the ability to reason about the implications of sampling decisions on generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to explicitly describe complex sampling strategies through composable sampling operators. This formalism supports both the specification and the reasoning about the generalizability of results based on the applied sampling strategies. We implement the DSL as a Python-based fluent API, and demonstrate how it facilitates representativeness reasoning using statistical indicators extracted from sampling workflows. We validate our approach through a case study of MSR papers involving code repository sampling. Our results show that the DSL can model the sampling strategies reported in recent literature.'

summary: 'Empirical software engineering research relies on sampling strategies to enable large-scale analyses of code repositories, where the design and evaluation of these strategies are critical for the generalizability of research findings. We propose a Domain-Specific Language that models sampling strategies as workflows with composable operators and automatically generates statistical indicators to support representativeness reasoning at each stage. Through a case study of MSR papers, we demonstrate the DSL can effectively capture real-world sampling strategies from recent literature.'
